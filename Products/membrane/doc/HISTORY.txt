Changelog for Membrane

   (name of developer listed in brackets)

membrane 1.1

    - removed deprecation messages in Plone 3.0 (Zope 2.10): Import of
      zope.app.annotation turned into zope.annotation 
      [jensens]

membrane 1.0


membrane 1.0b1

    - Introduced IUserChanger interface to separate the password
      changing from the user addition and deletion portions of
      IUserManagement. [rafrombrc]

    - Completed general implementation of roles, groups, properties
      plugins. [rafrombrc, jhammel, rmarianski]

membrane 0.3

    - Added a IUserManagement interface (from PlonePAS) to the
      usermanager.  It will be available to implementations that
      provide the corresponding IMembraneUserManagement interface
      directly or through adaptation.  This allows thing like
      PasswordResetTool to work.

    - Renamed package to 'membrane' from 'Membrane' to reflect current
      standard python naming conventions. [rafrombrc]

    - Major refactoring to use Zope 3 component engine to glue
      together all the pieces.  Mix-ins have been converted to
      adapters, providers are defined by implementation of specific
      interfaces. [rafrombrc]

membrane 0.2-alpha

    - Made Title in membrane_tool a ZCTextIndex too, so that
      enumerateGroups() of membrane_groups works without exact_match.

    - getUserName and getUserId indexes in membrane_tool are now of
      type ZCTextIndex, allowing us to do exact_match=False queries in
      MembraneUserManager.enumerateUsers.

      PluggableAuthService.enumerateUsers recommends treating id and
      login as "contains" search tokens, but with our text index we
      can only do "starts with" searches.  However, that's much better
      than returning () for every call that has "exact_match=False".
