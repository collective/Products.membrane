Content interfaces
------------------

The interfaces in this module define the various aspects a content object
must implement to be usable by membrane as a user or a group. The interfaces
are  based on the standard `PluggableAuthService` interfaces. This means that
the user will often be passed in as a parameter, even though it is already
called on the user object.

Content objects may either implement these interfaces directly, or be adaptable
to them.
